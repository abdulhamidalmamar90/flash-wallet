- Font for headers: 'Orbitron', a geometric sans-serif with a computerized, techy, scientific feel, which supports the Fintech application.
- Font for body: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif with a modern, machined, objective, neutral look, that works well with Orbitron and the rest of the app.
- Mobile-first design with a bottom navigation bar for easy access to core features.
- Glassmorphism cards with glowing effects on hover to provide a futuristic look and feel.
- Lucide-React icons, styled with the primary and secondary accent colors.
